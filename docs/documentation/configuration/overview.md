- **[contexts](/docs/reference/contexts)**: Sets of indexes are managed within so-called *contexts*; by default `bring` uses a pre-defined default *context* that comes with a set of *indexes* which are deemed of interest for a general audience. Like for example the already mentioned ``binaries`` index, which contains single-file executables.

Even though this is not covered in this quick-start guide it is easily possible to create and share your own *indexes*. Check out the [usage documentation](/docs/usage) for more details. In fact, this is actually the main use-case for ``bring``. But for the purpose of this quick start we will only concern ourselves with the default context, and it's default set of *indexes*. It pays to keep all that in mind though, as that will allow you to extrapolate other, more specific use-cases on your own.
