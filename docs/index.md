# **bring**

**Manage files declaratively and deterministically, with minimal configuration.**

*bring* is the package manager for generic files you never knew you wanted. It lets you enrich your own as well as other peoples published files with metadata, which in turn allows you to specify the layout of folder structures in a very concise and easy to manage way.
